## Process

Set up the interactive canvas:

1. Use the HTML canvas element as the drawing surface for your logic gates and wires.
Integrate a library like Konva.js or Fabric.js that simplifies working with canvas and provides drag-and-drop functionality.
Design the logic gate components:

2. Create JavaScript classes or functional components for each logic gate (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
Define the visual representation (could be SVGs or canvas drawings).
Implement drag-and-drop functionality:

3. Allow users to drag gates onto the canvas and move them around freely.
Make sure gates have connection points (inputs and outputs) that are easily accessible for wiring.
Develop a wiring system:

4. Create a mechanism for drawing wires between gates’ connection points.
Ensure that the wires are interactive—users should be able to click to create, drag to connect, and maybe double-click to remove.
Handle the logic gate operations:

Each gate class should implement its own logic, taking binary input and producing the correct output.
State management:

Maintain a global state to keep track of all gates and wires.
You might want to use a state management library like Redux or React Context API for complex states.
Simulation flow:

Implement a simulation engine that processes inputs through the gates and updates the outputs.
UI/UX:

Design a user-friendly interface with Tailwind CSS.
Include features like undo/redo, saving/loading circuits, and maybe even a library of pre-built circuits.
Testing and Debugging:

Rigorous testing for both functionality and usability.
Offer debugging tools or features within the simulator, like highlighting the active signal path.
Performance optimization:

Optimize rendering and state updates, especially as the circuits become complex.
Deployment and Scaling:

Make sure it integrates well with your existing Next.js application and works across different browsers.
